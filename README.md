# Meet_Bob
Meet Bob, worldâ€™s worst market timer... or just a lucky scammer?

You may know Bob, he is the worst market timer in the world. 
He bought shares only 4 times in his life just before last 4 Market crashes (not counting Corona's) and still he retired with a good lump of extra money.
Llet's see if Bob was just lucky or the idea behind his plan makes sense.

Methodology:
I'm going to check what happens if you invest a fixed amount of money per month buying an index and holding it for n Years. 
Also which was the best period to buy and hold and the worst one. 
On top of the indexes I also contemplated an hypothetical TER.
Because Bob, or actually these Bobs are bad timers they were buying shares at month's high.
